                     LIFE WELL LIVED LICENSE - Version 1, 2023-02-16

Copyright Â© 2023 citrusella.

Anyone can use, copy, or distribute this license, but they cannot change its terms.

                    Introduction/Explanation

At the time of creating this license, I was trying to figure out a way, whether enforceable or just symbolic, to convey a wish that people not sell or modify a piece of software I no longer intended to update. But nothing that I found on the internet conveyed quite the vibe I wanted. I eventually said while chatting with someone that I wanted the software to be able to die after a life well lived once it stopped working, and right then and there, I decided perhaps I should write my own license to convey things in exactly the words I wished to use to declare how I wanted people to be able to use the work.

While it CAN be used for any work, this license is primarily intended for works which can be regularly updated (like, say, software code) but which are no longer receiving updates and have been "laid to rest" by their creator. Think of it like a software's last will and testament or a eulogy to a software or other work that lived a good life but has simply reached its retirement and eventual death.

Cheers to a life well lived.

                      Terms and Conditions

This work MUST be shared alongside its "death certificate" (this license) so that people are aware of these terms.

By using this work, you acknowledge that it is retired and may be on its deathbed or disappear without notice. This work is provided as is, with no warranty, and you understand that it has been laid to rest and thus might not receive updates. Its author(s) cannot, under any kind of legal claim, be held liable for any potential damage related to this work, any failure of this work to update, or its license.

Here is what you MAY do with a work using this license:

FEEL FREE TO KEEP A PERSONAL MEMENTO TO REMEMBER IT BY. You MAY make a personal copy for private use. You MAY keep this personal copy even if the published work is deleted by its original author or otherwise disappears from the Internet. As detailed in the MAY NOT section, this only applies to personal private copies and not to publishing or distributing exact/unmodified copies.

FEEL FREE TO MAKE PERSONAL CHANGES THAT HELP YOU TO COPE WITH THIS WORK'S BEING LAID TO REST. You MAY make modifications to or derivatives of a personal copy of this work for private use. You MAY keep this modified or derivative copy even if the published work is deleted by its original author or otherwise disappears from the Internet. As detailed in the MAY NOT section, this only applies to personal private copies, and you may not publish or distribute a modified copy to others.

Here is what you MAY NOT do with a work using this license:

NO NECROMANCY! You MAY NOT publish or distribute an exact copy or unmodified fork of this work other than its original copy by its original author/credits at its original published location. This is true even if the work stops working or is deleted by its original author.

NO FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER! You MAY NOT publish or distribute modifications to or derivatives of this work, even if the work stops working or is deleted by its original author. This includes using parts of it in another work.

NO SELLING THE WORK OR ITS ORGANS ON THE BLACK MARKET! You MAY NOT sell any part of this work for any kind of currency, and you MAY NOT use it to aid a commercial venture that makes you revenue in any kind of currency. This is true even if the work stops working or is deleted by its original author. You ARE FORBIDDEN make money off of this work in ANY way in ANY currency, either directly or by association.

Here is what happens if you do not follow these rules:

If the work was previously licensed under a more permissive (and irrevocable) license:
That license might (probably does) still apply, or at least it applied to previous versions of the work, if parts of the work were changed or updated after this license was applied. In that case, this license might not be enforceable and thus is largely meant as an expression of the author's wishes.

If the work was not previously licensed under a more permissive license:
This license is the one that applies. You may be subject to consequences if this license is violated. If this license was written in a way that makes it not legally enforceable, you may still be subject to karmic consequences for having angered the ghost of a dead work. And honestly, who really WANTS to be haunted by ART or CODE? Seriously.

Just don't violate the license.
