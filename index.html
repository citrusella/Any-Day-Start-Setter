<p><strong>By using this tool, you acknowledge the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You understand <a href="https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Custom_Day_Start#Examples_and_a_Warning_about_Late_Custom_Day_Start_Times">the warning about late Custom Day Starts on the Custom Day Start page on Habitica Wiki</a> (and are unlikely to contact staff about how late day starts work because you understand it is not a bug that they function that way).<ul>
	<li>To summarize here: Late day starts cannot move <em>backward</em> from midnight (the default day start time), only forward. This means that your day will start however many hours <em>later</em> than midnight you set, and it cannot move backward and start <em>earlier</em>.</li>
</ul>
	</li>
<li>You understand that this tool could permanently stop working at any time, if the API's behavior is modified to match the available times on the website and block/error on the selection of other times.</li>
<li>You understand that changing your day start to a time after 12pm (noon / +12) will cause the website's day start dropdown to become blank. This is a side effect of those times no longer being a valid setting in the website's interface even though your account can still be set to them behind the scenes.</li></ul>
